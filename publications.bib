  abstract = {In several jurisdictions, rules on interest rate ceilings - usually treated under the concept of ``usury laws'' are an important part of the regulation of consumer credit, not without a constant controversy about the real beneffits to debtors, especially those with fewer resources. At first glance, the Chilean regime of interest rate ceilings seems to be particularly robust since it considers four different legal sanctions if a lender charges a higher interest than allowed: (1) a criminal penalty, (2) a contractual sanction consistent with reducing the interest rate applicable to the operation, (3) an infraction of the Consumer Protection Act that enables the consumer-debtor to bring a civil liability case before the court, and (4) an administrative penalty imposed by the Chilean banking supervisor, the latter being incorporated in the most recent amendment to the act governing credit transactions of money, along with a new set of ceilings, based upon different amounts and types of loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as we will discuss in this paper, in the case of credit cards, a review of some of the terms and conditions widely used in the market suggests that the design that suppliers have given their contracts, along with certain terminological vagueness in the regulation currently in force, provides scenarios of possible circumvention of the law. In addition, from a comparison between the substantive regulation of lending and duties of (mandated) disclosure of information in consumer credit contracts, we will highlight certain areas of discrepancy (if not downright contradiction) between these regulations that aect how consumers can perceive the costs associated with the use of credit cards.},

	abstract = {Chilean consumer law and policy has a short but enthralling history. As compared with other jurisdictions such as EU countries, its bedrock is still in formation, particularly pertaining to its envisaged role in the regulatory spectrum applicable to consumer markets. However, this circumstance has not been a serious obstacle to several reforms carried out in recent years aimed at broadening its scope of action, including rethinking a proposal regarding the policy goals to be addressed by the national consumer agency, SERNAC. In that context, this article presents a brief account of the main features of Chilean consumer law, considering the current socioeconomic development level of the country, the main pieces of legislation concerning consumer protection in the Chilean legal framework—notably the Chilean Consumer Protection Act—as well as key elements of the public policy approach in this matter. A few examples of topics such as product liability and sale and purchase of consumer goods are also analysed in order to allow a comparison of the Chilean experience in consumer protection with other jurisdictions.},
